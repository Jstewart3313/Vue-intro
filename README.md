## Challenge

learn Vue.js by utilizing the nasa API, Which was currently down at the time of my challenge. In order to work through I set up local mock data withouth the fetch, which allowed me to continue to learn Vue and its components withouth worrying about skills I already know.

## Technologies

I used axios for the first time to attempt my fetch calls, while it did work, I was impressed with the benefits of axios and the response it gave against the the traditional fetch.
